# NotePad
Projectâ€™s Problem Statement: Develop a mobile application that can be used to create and manage notes.This notepad application/project allows users to persist notes data temporarily in local storage. Aim: -          To test members knowledge on persisting or caching data in mobile app development Features: -          Users can create, read, update and delete notes. Note: All packages aside shared preferences are allowed. Hint: A typical solution is to create an application that can take in user input and save it as a note. There should be a page where all notes can be fetched. As a user, I want to be able to select a note, edit the content and save the new details successfully.
